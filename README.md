# GithubJavaPK
Android application which gets all Pakistani Java developers over the GitHub platform.
<br/>This application uses following resources:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.github.com/">GitHub API</a> - for fetching data about Pakistani Java developers over the GitHub platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit">Retrofit</a> - for sending web requests and fetching data from the web.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide">Glide</a> - for loading images from URLs inside the application.</li>
</ol>
The application is being developed for just testing these resources and modules used in this application will be used in a bigger app.<br/>
This might expand to something else later on... So hold tight!
